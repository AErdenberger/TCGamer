# README

TCGamer is a clone of TCGPlayer, a market place to purchase, sell, and evaluate cards from many different card games. TCGPlayer sells sealed product as well as individual cards for each TCG as well as collectibles and comics as well. 

TCGamer is a storefront for Magic: the Gathering, Pokemon, and YuGiOh. Users can filter, search, and purchase cards on the site.


Technologies used to achieve this were React/Redux Libraries for Components on the frontend, Ruby-on-Rails is my backend database, NPM runs my code, AmazonS3 stores image data from my database, and Render hosts the website in its entirety.

2 Features I am particularly proud of are the Search and the display of the Cards themselves
